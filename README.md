## About Me

I am a cybersecurity-focused student with strong interests in endpoint security, system hardening, enterprise IT operations, and automation. During my internship at Bank of China Singapore Branch, I managed large-scale endpoint security systems, coordinated operating system upgrade projects, and developed internal automation tools using VBA and Python.

This portfolio showcases projects that best represent my technical skills and readiness for university-level computing and cybersecurity programmes.
